There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n","\n","Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n","\n","You have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n","\n","You have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"16f77bd6-c532-48d3-ac2e-ccf643c5bbcc","metadata":{},"source":["### Content:\n","1.

Schools\n","- **Objective**: Find schools with the highest SAT math, reading, and writing scores.\n","- **Why?**: This will highlight excellence and can inform educational policymakers or parents about where students are excelling.\n","- **How to measure success**: Use sorting and filtering techniques to isolate top performers by individual subject scores and total SAT scores.\n","\n","#### Analyze Performance Variation Across Boroughs\n","- **Objective**: Compare test scores across NYC boroughs to understand if there are significant differences in performance.\n","- **Why?**: This can reveal regional disparities and help target areas that may require more resources or attention.\n","- **How to measure success**: Calculate average SAT scores per borough, along with the standard deviation to show consistency or variability in test performance.\n","\n","#### Find the Top 10 Performing Schools\n","- **Objective**: Rank the top 10 schools based on total SAT score (math + reading + writing).\n","- **Why?**: This provides a clear snapshot of the highest overall academic performance across schools.\n","- **How to measure success**: Use aggregated data to compute total scores and then rank the schools in descending order.\n","\n","#### Analyze Subject-Specific Strengths and Weaknesses\n","- **Objective**: Determine which schools excel in specific subjects (math, reading, writing) versus overall performance.\n","- **Why?**: Understanding subject-specific strengths can inform curriculum improvements or tutoring focus areas.\n","- **How to measure success**: Visualize performance across different subjects for the top schools and compare them."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"17afecb1-7c80-4859-88dd-b5a0b612cb0e","metadata":{},"source":["### Data Exploration and
